- Compiler does static analysis to discover single use modifications
  - Use plain pointer if mutation flow goes through multiple functions
  - Copy can be skipped
  - Can add local assertions to ensure this condition
- Compiler also discovers copies that are shared simply as read-only
  - Also use plain pointer, not full COW struct
