## Type Spec System: Design Goals and Philosophy

### Purpose

A **type spec** describes how a type behaves — its capabilities, guarantees, and relationships to other types.
Where traditional trait or interface systems dictate “what must be implemented,” type specs instead **codify reasoning**: they express truths about values that let both humans and compilers infer valid transformations.

Type specs exist to make _reasoning portable_: across modules, libraries, and minds.

---

## Goals

### 1. **Expressivity without Entropy**

A type spec should capture powerful abstractions (functoriality, serialization, concurrency safety) without spawning complexity.

- Every additional rule must serve clarity.
- Specialization, derivation, and constraint logic exist only if they can be explained simply.

### 2. **Deterministic Resolution**

Instance selection is not inference sorcery. Given a call site and visible imports, there is always one unambiguous implementation.
This guarantees reproducible builds, stable reasoning, and predictable error messages.

### 3. **Ergonomic Generality**

Specs must be easy to write and read. Implementations should feel _local_ to the types they describe, not scattered through magical instance graphs.
The cognitive distance between “this value behaves like X” and “here’s where that’s defined” should be near zero.

### 4. **Compositional Performance**

Algorithmic specialization and conditional implementations are part of the design, not afterthoughts.
Compile-time selection of efficient paths should be safe and obvious, never hidden behind template black magic.

### 5. **Reasoning Integration**

Type specs exist for both humans and compilers to reason with.
They enable static proofs of correctness, safe parallelization, and optimization — all emergent from explicit semantics, not compiler heuristics.

---

## Core Principles

### Determinism

Resolution of specs is explicit, ordered, and reproducible.
Ambiguity is treated as an error, not as a puzzle to be solved.
This means overlapping conditions or multiple viable implementations must be disambiguated explicitly.

### Locality

Implementations live alongside the types they describe, or are imported deliberately.
No global orphan instances, no invisible coherence failures.
This upholds the manifesto’s call for _reasoning transparency_.

### Parametric Precision

Specs support higher-kinded parameters so that generic behavior over type constructors is first-class.
Conditional definitions allow refinement (“this spec applies only when T = Bool” or “when U satisfies Comparable”), enabling selective specialization without runtime cost.

### Explicit Conditions

Conditional conformance replaces ad-hoc multi-parameter relations.
Every spec can express guard clauses over its parameters, and the compiler treats those guards as part of its proof context.
This gives the expressive power of C++’s partial specialization and Haskell’s type-class constraints — but within a deterministic, ergonomically constrained model.

### Separation of Concerns

Specs describe _capability_, not _conversion_.
Conversions, adapters, and domain-specific relations are explicit, cheap constructs.
This keeps the spec system conceptually small and avoids relational ambiguity.

### Predictable Specialization

Specialization is explicit and ordered: generic implementations provide defaults; more specific ones refine behavior.
The compiler chooses deterministically by specificity, not by search.
Users can see — and override — which path is taken.

## Tradeoffs

| Benefit                                                     | Cost / Constraint                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Expressive generic abstractions                             | Requires careful discipline in conditional logic to avoid ambiguity                  |
| Deterministic, predictable resolution                       | Less automatic “magic” than Haskell-style inference                                  |
| Cheap specialization                                        | Compiler and programmer must agree on specificity rules                              |
| Explicit conditions instead of full relational polymorphism | Fewer accidental overlaps, but sometimes more verbose code                           |
| Ergonomic HKTs                                              | Type system complexity increases; requires strong tooling support                    |
| Local coherence                                             | Libraries can’t retroactively add behaviors to foreign types without explicit import |

## What This System Opens Up

1. **Algorithmic Specialization**

   - Compile-time selection of optimized algorithms based on static properties (“vectorized path for Bool”, “GPU kernel for numeric matrix”) without runtime branching.

2. **Safer, Smarter Generics**

   - Generic code that’s as ergonomic as dynamic polymorphism but as predictable as manual specialization.

3. **Declarative Optimization**

   - Users can describe _why_ one implementation applies — not just _how_. The compiler leverages this for proof-guided optimization.

4. **Human-Readable Proofs**

   - Because every constraint is explicit, the reasoning chain for any behavior is inspectable: “X behaves like Y because these specs hold.”

5. **Tooling Synergy**

   - IDEs, analyzers, and LLMs can reason about capability graphs deterministically, offering precise assistance rather than heuristics.

6. **Ergonomic Meta-Programming**

   - Derivation and defaulting happen through spec logic, not macros; meaning fewer hidden transformations, more semantic clarity.

7. **Unified Concept of Capability**

   - From functors to concurrency safety to numerical traits, all fit within one reasoning model — the language doesn’t splinter into ad-hoc feature systems.

---

## Summary

The **type spec system** replaces the noise of ad-hoc polymorphism with a clean, deterministic contract language.
It retains the expressive power needed for real abstractions — higher-kinded generics, specialization, conditional behavior — but grounds them in the manifesto’s triad:

- **Ergonomics:** writing and reading specs should feel like describing truths, not solving puzzles.
- **Determinism:** resolution is unambiguous and repeatable.
- **Efficiency:** specialization and reasoning yield faster programs by design, not by ritual.
