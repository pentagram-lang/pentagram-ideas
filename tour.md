# Pentagram Tour

## 1. Fundamentals

Let's start with the absolute basics. Here you'll see how to write a simple program, make notes in your code with comments, and name values using variables.

### Hello World

The simplest program in Pentagram prints a message. Functions, like `say`, are placed after the data they operate on.

```pentagram
'Hello world!' say,
```

### Comments

You can write comments to leave notes for yourself or other programmers. They start and end with `--` and can span multiple lines.

```pentagram
-- This is a comment --
--
This is a comment that
spans multiple lines.
--
--- You can add more hyphens -- to nest comments ---
```

### Variable Assignment

Variables are used to give names to values. In Pentagram, variables are immutable; when you "change" a variable, you are actually creating a new one with the same name that shadows the old one. This makes code more predictable.

```pentagram
-- Create two variables and use them together --
foo = 40,
bar = 2,
baz = foo bar +,

-- Each binding creates a new variable in a nested scope --
x = 1,           -- x is 1 --
x = x 2 +,       -- A new x is created with the value 3 --
x = x 3 *,       -- Another new x is created with the value 9 --

-- The `_=` syntax is sugar for this common rebinding pattern --
x = 1,
x _= 2 +,        -- Equivalent to: x = x 2 +, --

y = sv 1, 2 end-sv,
y _= 3 pushr,    -- Equivalent to: y = y 3 pushr, --

-- Rebinding a record's field creates a new record --
x = y: 1 z,
x.y = 2,         -- Sugar for: x = x 2 z.set-y, --
```

## 2. Primitive Values

Pentagram includes a standard set of primitive value types for representing simple data. All operations, including arithmetic and comparisons, are treated as regular postfix functions.

### Numbers

Numbers support standard arithmetic operations.

```pentagram
foo-1 = 1 2 +,
foo-2 = foo-1 3 -,
foo-3 = foo-2 4 *,
foo-4 = foo-3 5 /,

-- Negation is a special suffix operator --
foo-1 = 1-,
foo-2 = foo-1-,
```

### Text

Text values support concatenation and interpolation. There are no backslash escapes; instead, special characters are handled with square-bracket syntax, and literal quotes can be included by using different outer quotes.

```pentagram
-- Interpolation and concatenation --
foo = 'e',
bar = 'abc' 'd[foo]' cat,

-- Sugar for special characters --
foo = 'a[nl]b[tb]c',

-- Using alternative quotes to include literal quotes --
foo = "a'b'",
bar = `a'"b'`,
```

### Booleans

Booleans support standard logic operators, which will short-circuit. All comparison operators are spelled-out functions for clarity.

```pentagram
-- Logic operators --
foo-1 = true f false g and,
foo-2 = true f false g or,
foo-3 = true not,

-- Comparison operators --
foo-1 = 1 2 eq,      -- Equal --
foo-2 = 3 4 ne,      -- Not equal --
foo-3 = 5 6 gt,      -- Greater than --
foo-4 = 7 8 gte,     -- Greater than or equal to --
foo-5 = 9 10 lt,     -- Less than --
foo-6 = 11 12 lte,   -- Less than or equal to --
```

## 3. Data Structures

Pentagram provides both literal collections for simple data grouping and specialized wrapper types that add semantics like optionality, reference, or mutability.

### Literal Collections

Pentagram has built-in syntax for common, un-typed collections. These resolve to default types if not constrained by the context.

```pentagram
foo = gv 1, 2, 3 end-gv,    -- A group of unordered values --
bar = sv 1, 2, 3 end-sv,    -- A sequence of ordered values --
baz = kv 1 'a', 2 3 end-kv, -- A map of keyed values --
```

### Value Wrappers

These types provide wrappers for values to give them different semantics.

```pentagram
foo = nil,     -- Represents an absent value --
bar = 1 val,   -- Represents an optional value that is present --

baz = 1 ref,   -- An immutable reference to a value --

qux = 1 mut,   -- A mutable box for holding state --

quux = 1 laz,  -- A lazily-computed value --
```

### Field Access

The `.` operator is used to access named fields on records, while the `*` operator is syntactic sugar for accessing the primary wrapped value of a wrapper type.

```pentagram
x = 1 ref,
y = x*,                    -- Reads the value via ref.get-value --
x* = 2,                    -- Rebinds x to a new ref via ref.set-value --

x = 1 laz,
y = x*,                    -- Forces computation via laz.get-value --

-- Optional values must be narrowed before accessing the value --
x = 1 val,
if x.is-val begin
  y = x*                   -- Accesses the value inside the 'val' --
end-if,

-- Mutable boxes are the main exception to the rebinding rule --
x = 1 mut,
y = x*,                    -- Reads the value via mut.get-value --
x 2 write-mut,             -- This performs actual mutation. There is no sugar --
```

## 4. Functions and Control Flow

All programs are built from functions and control-flow structures. This section covers how Pentagram defines and calls functions, how to branch logic with conditionals, and how to loop.

### Postfix and Prefix Notation

Pentagram has two ways to call functions. The default is **postfix**, which is ideal for chaining operations.

```pentagram
-- Postfix style reads like a series of transformations --
result = 5 2 + 3 *,   -- (5 + 2) * 3 --
```

For functions that take blocks of code or have complex arguments, **prefix notation** can be clearer. This is done by wrapping the function's arguments in a `with-<fn-name>...end-<fn-name>` block.

```pentagram
-- Calling the 'map' function with prefix notation --
numbers = sv 1, 2, 3 end-sv,
doubled = with-map
  numbers,
  fn n begin n 2 * end-fn,
end-map,

-- This is equivalent to the postfix version --
doubled = numbers fn n begin n 2 * end-fn map,
```

### Conditionals

Conditional `if` blocks are used to branch execution based on a boolean value.

```pentagram
if condition begin
  'true branch' say
elif other-condition begin
  'elif branch' say
else
  'false branch' say
end-if,

-- Conditionals are also used to narrow tagged union variants --
if pet.is-dog begin
  -- Inside this branch, pet is known to be a dog --
  pet.breed say
end-if,
```

### Loops

Pentagram provides `loop` for infinite loops and `while` for conditional loops.

```pentagram
-- An infinite loop --
loop
  'forever' say
end-loop,

-- A conditional loop --
while condition begin
  'looping' say
end-while,
```

### Function Definition

Use `def fn` to define a named function. Type annotations can be used for parameters and return values.

```pentagram
def f fn
  par x i8,
  par y i8,
  i8
begin
  z = 1 ty i8 end-ty as,
  x y + z +
end-fn,
```

### Named Arguments

Function arguments can be passed by name. This is often used for clarity, especially for functions with many parameters.

```pentagram
-- Passing arguments by name in postfix notation --
foo = name: 'dog' sound: 'bark' animal,

-- Named arguments also work well with prefix notation --
bar = with-animal
  name: 'cat',
  sound: 'meow',
end-animal,
```

### Closures

Anonymous functions, or closures, can be defined inline and capture immutable variables from their outer scope.

```pentagram
-- A closure that captures 'x' --
x = 10,
add-x = fn y begin y x + end-fn,
result = 5 add-x.call,  -- result is 15 --

-- Each closure captures the values in scope when it is created --
base = 5,
f1 = fn x begin x base + end-fn,
base = 10,
f2 = fn x begin x base + end-fn,
-- f1.call will add 5; f2.call will add 10 --
```

## 5. The Type System

Pentagram has a strong, nominal type system designed to ensure correctness while remaining ergonomic. It supports generics, traits (called specifications), and even higher-kinded types.

### Type Annotations

In Pentagram, variables themselves are untyped; they simply hold values. Type annotations are applied to values on the expression stack using `ty` fences.

```pentagram
-- Annotating a value on the stack --
x = 42 ty i8 end-ty as,

-- Type fences can wrap complex expressions --
result = 1 ty i8 end-ty as 2 ty i8 end-ty as +,

-- Variables bind to the typed value --
y = x,
```

### Custom Types

You can define your own data structures using **Records** (for grouping data) and **Tagged Unions** (for variations).

#### Records

Records are product types with named fields.

```pentagram
-- Define a record --
def person rec
  par name txt,
  par age u8,
end-rec,

-- Create an instance --
p = person name: 'Alice' age: 30,

-- Access fields --
p-name = p person.name,
```

#### Tagged Unions

Tagged unions allow you to define a type that can be one of several variants.

```pentagram
-- Define a tag --
def shape tag,

-- Define variants --
def shape.circle rec
  par radius f32,
end-rec,

def shape.square rec
  par side-length f32,
end-rec,
```

### Specifications (Traits)

Specifications (or "specs") define shared behavior that different types can implement. This is similar to interfaces or traits in other languages.

```pentagram
-- Define a specification --
def serializable spec
  tpar t type,
end-spec,
def serializable.to-bytes fn
  par self t,
  byte-seq
end-fn,

-- Implement the spec for a type --
def user-serializable impl user serializable end-impl,
def user-serializable.to-bytes fn
  par self user,
  byte-seq
begin
  self.id to-bytes
end-fn,
```

### Generics

Types and functions can be generic, allowing them to work with any type that satisfies certain constraints.

#### Generic Types

```pentagram
-- A generic record --
def box rec
  tpar t type,
  par value t,
end-rec,

-- Explicit and inferred type parameters --
x = 1 ty value: i8 box end-ty as, -- Explicit --
y = 2 ty box end-ty as,           -- Inferred --
z = 3 box,                        -- Fully inferred --

-- A generic tagged union --
def result tag
  tpar ok type,
  tpar err type,
end-tag,

def result.success rec
  par value result.ok,
end-rec,

def result.failure rec
  par error result.err,
end-rec,
```

#### Generic Functions

Functions can declare type parameters (`tpar`) and apply constraints (like requiring a type to implement `ord`).

```pentagram
def max fn
  tpar t type,
  par a t,
  par b t,
  t ord,                -- Constraint: t must implement ord --
  t
begin
  if a b gt begin a else b end-if
end-fn,
```

### Higher-Kinded Types

Pentagram supports higher-kinded types, meaning type parameters can themselves be generic (like a type constructor). This allows for powerful abstractions like `functor`.

```pentagram
-- The functor spec operates on a type constructor 'f' --
def functor spec
  tpar f fn tpar t type, type end-fn,
end-spec,

def functor.map fn
  tpar a type,
  tpar b type,
  par self a functor.f.call,
  par transform fn par x a, b end-fn,
  b functor.f.call
end-fn,

-- Implementing functor for 'box' --
def box-functor impl
  f: fn t begin t box end-fn box functor
end-impl,

def box-functor.map fn
  tpar a type,
  tpar b type,
  par self a box,
  par transform fn par x a, b end-fn,
  b box
begin
  self* transform.call box
end-fn,
```

## 6. Error Handling

Pentagram treats error handling as a core part of the program's logic, not an afterthought. Errors are explicit, typed, and context-aware, ensuring you always know where and why things might go wrong.

### Error Declaration & Handling

Functions that can fail must explicitly declare `err` in their signature. Callers are then required to handle this possibility, either by propagating the error with `?` or capturing it with `try`.

```pentagram
-- Functions declare 'err' if they can fail --
def f fn
  par x bool,
  err,
  bool
begin
  if x begin
    note: 'condition was true' err? -- Propagate an error --
  else
    false
  end-if
end-fn,

-- Handling the error --
-- 1 f,        -- Compile error: must handle the error --
y = 1 f?,      -- Propagate the error to the caller --
z = 1 f.try,   -- Capture the error in a 'result' type --
```

### Error Context & Marks

Unlike exceptions in other languages, Pentagram errors don't carry data themselves. Instead, context is provided by **marks**—values attached to the current scope. When an error occurs, the runtime captures all active marks.

```pentagram
-- Define typed marks for context --
def file-path mark txt end-mark,
def retry-count mark u8 end-mark,

def open-file fn
  par path txt,
  err,
  file
begin
  -- Apply marks to the following block --
  > path file-path,
  > 0 retry-count,
  path open-internal?    -- If this fails, marks are captured --
end-fn,

-- Reading captured marks --
result = 'data.txt' open-file.try,
if result.is-err begin
  -- Retrieve context from the captured error --
  path = result.err get-mark ty file-path opt end-ty as,
end-if,
```

### Crashes

A **crash** is different from an error: it indicates a bug or an unrecoverable state (like a failed assertion) and terminates the current task immediately.

```pentagram
-- Terminate immediately --
if bad-state begin
  crash
end-if,

-- 'must' asserts a condition and crashes if it's false --
x 0 gt must,

-- Crashes also capture marks for diagnostics --
> 'validating input' note,
input valid must,
```

## 7. Modules & Exports

Modules help you organize your code into namespaces and control what is visible to the rest of the program.

### Visibility & Exports

By default, everything defined in a module is private. To make a function or type available to other modules, you must explicitly mark it with `pub`.

```pentagram
def utils mod
  -- This helper is private to the module --
  def helper fn
    par x i8,
    i8
  begin
    x 2 *
  end-fn,

  -- This function is public and can be imported --
  pub def process fn
    par x i8,
    i8
  begin
    x helper
  end-fn
end-mod,
```

### Imports

Use the `use` keyword to bring public items from other modules into your current scope. You can rename imports with `as` to avoid conflicts or shorten names.

```pentagram
-- Import a specific item --
use pkg.utils.process,
result = 5 process,

-- Import with an alias --
use pkg.utils.process as p,
result = 5 p,
```

### Privacy Bypassing

Sometimes, especially when writing tests, you need to access private implementation details. Pentagram allows you to bypass visibility rules explicitly using `non-pub`.

```pentagram
-- Explicitly import a private item --
use pkg.utils.internal-helper non-pub,

-- A common pattern for testing internal logic --
def utils.test mod
  use pkg.utils.internal-helper non-pub,

  test
    result = 5 internal-helper,
    result 10 eq assert
  end-test
end-mod,
```

## 8. Testing

Testing is built directly into the language. You can define tests right alongside your code, making it easy to verify correctness.

### Basic Tests

A `test` block isolates test logic. Inside, you can perform operations and use `assert` to verify results.

```pentagram
test
  x = 1 2 +,
  x 3 eq assert
end-test,
```

### Parameterized Tests

For testing multiple inputs against expected outputs, you can use **rich comments**. These allow you to define a table of test cases that are passed as arguments to the test block.

```pentagram
--
Check addition works correctly

==
1 2 3 test-case,
5 7 12 test-case,
0 0 0 test-case,
==
--
test
  par a i8,
  par b i8,
  par expected i8
begin
  a b + expected eq assert
end-test,
```

## 9. Advanced Syntax

Pentagram includes a few specialized syntax features to help manage complexity in large or deeply nested codebases.

### Custom Block Delimiters

When you have many nested blocks, it can be hard to tell which `end-if` or `end-loop` closes which block. You can add custom markers to delimiters to make the structure explicit.

```pentagram
-- A marked conditional block --
if-'marker' condition begin
  'marked branch' say
end-if-'marker',
```
