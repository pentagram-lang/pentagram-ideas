# Pentagram ideas / Plans / Keyboard symbols

## Available symbols

_For non-US keyboards_

Tier 1 (friendly):
```
-=;,.!%*()"_+:?
```

Tier 2 (okay):
```
'/@#$&
```

Tier 3 (unfriendly):
```
<>^`[]\~{}|
```

## Custom use

Because symbols are so important for extending the functionality of the lanugage, custom use of symbols is not permitted. You can't define methods for your own symbols.

To define custom behaviour for one of the builtin language symbols, define the matching literal operator method.
