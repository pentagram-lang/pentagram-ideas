# Tacit ideas / Plans / Enviroment activation

## Rationale

* Well-used languages need coexisting versions for different workspaces
* IDEs and shells need to be able to easily activate the specific language version
* Each workspace also has its own set of dependencies and CLI tools

## Solution

### Initialization

* Developers install a specific version of Tacit, e.g. 1.1
* Environments are initialized using `tacit1.1 init`
* Creates a .tacit folder together with .envrc and tacit.toml
* .tacit has a bin subdirectory (which has a `tacit` symlink) and also stores all of the workspace packages 
* tacit.toml has a Tacit version line
* If running interactive in a direnv-compatible shell ($SHELL) with direnv not installed (`which direnv`), suggest installing direnv
* Prompt to run `direnv allow .` if direnv is installed

### Activation
* For direnv, .envrc has one line `eval "$(tacit1.1 env bash)"`
* Developers can manually invoke `tacit1.1 env` for their shell
* IDEs can find the Tacit version from tacit.toml, and just start up the language server

### Upgrading Tacit
* Check that new version is installed
* Upgrade tacit.toml
* Upgrade .envrc (prompt with diff if not the exact simple version generated by Tacit)
