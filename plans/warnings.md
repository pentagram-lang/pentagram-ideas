# Tacit ideas / Plans / Warnings

## Suppression

Warnings can be suppressed in project config globally, for whole files, for blocks, for next lines, and for current lines.

## Private usage

Any identifiers (variable, method, module) with a private prefix used outside will generate a warning.

## Unused variable

To explicitly mark a parameter or variable or value as unused, use it in an expression that drops it.
